# REST API for Online Cab Booking Application

We have created a REST API for online cab booking application which can be used by customers to login into their profile, update their information and 
book cabs, by a driver to login and update their details along with their cab details and accept a ride from the customer. All this is over looked by the 
admin who can also login and update their information as well as access the data in the application.
